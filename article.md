South Africa’s intimate partner femicide rate – **5.5 women per 100,000** – is about **five times the global average**.  
On an ‘average’ day, around **15 women are murdered**, roughly one every 1.6 hours.

### Day 4 – Who is murdering our women?

  <img src="img/day4_murders_who_kills.png" alt="Same 15 dots, with 9 in red for partner/family and 6 in grey for other perpetrators" width="90%">
</p>

Out of these 15 women, **about 9 are killed by an intimate partner or a family member**.

Femicide in South Africa is not evenly distributed. It hits **younger women**, **African women**, and women in certain provinces – especially **Eastern Cape** and **Gauteng** – much harder.  

When a woman is killed in South Africa, chances are high her killer will never be held accountable.  
In 2020/21, fewer than **1 in 5** intimate partner killers and about **1 in 8** non-partner killers were convicted.

</p>

Between 1999 and 2009, South Africa **dramatically reduced femicide**.  

But in the last decade, progress has stalled – and **intimate partner femicide is rising again**, even as overall femicide stays high by global standards.
