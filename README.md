Gender differences in population subjected to sexual violence


Framing:
1. "By the time you’ve been at work for 8 hours, about 5 women have been killed somewhere in the country."
2. "In a WhatsApp group of 20 friends, about 7 have..."
3. “If 100 women are in a room, about 34 of them have…”
4. “In a taxi of 15 women, about 5 have experienced…”
5. For every 1 man who reports being hurt by a partner, X women do.”
6. “Men are about Y times more likely to report perpetrating physical violence than women are to report perpetrating it.”
7. “In a class of 30 students, about Z have grown up seeing their father hurt their mother.”
8. “In a clinic waiting room of 20 women, roughly N have been forced into sex by a partner at some point in their lives.”

Visualising:
1. Waffle charts (10×10 grid: each square = 1 person).
2. Dot grids (15/20 circles, some coloured).
3. Big-number cards for key stats (“One woman killed every 1.6 hours”).
4. Before/after tiles for change over time (“Then vs now”).

Theme A – How big is the crisis?
Day 1 – “If 100 women in South Africa are in a room, how many have been hurt by a partner or another person?”
Day 2 – “In a taxi of 15 women, how many are living with violence right now?”
Day 3 – “By the time you go to bed tonight, how many women will have been killed?”
Day 4 – “Is home actually the safest place for women?”
